            You wake up hungry. You go to the fridge and make yourself a massive
            plate of eggs & hashbrowns. Or maybe today you’re feeling a greek
            yogurt bowl with granola & fruit. But no, what about that slice of
            pizza you didn’t finish last night? Is that against breakfast law?
            What if you woke up and it was 1000 BC? I don’t think your
            prehistoric fridge will have any dinosaur eggs. And I imagine the
            Greeks were busy getting ready for their first Olympics rather than
            formulating their yogurt recipe we’ve all come to love. Food has
            undergone one of the greatest evolutions of resources since the
            first humans walked the Earth, not only in form & usage but also in
            symbolism. The evolution of food is one of the greatest indicators
            of the sheer achievement humans have experienced since our
            inception, and we are only at the beginning of it.

            This one is probably the most obvious. For thousands of years, we
            were hunters & gatherers. We ate raw meat and chewed on tree bark
            (yes we did). Today, we still eat raw meat (ask our CFO about his
            choice of steak tartare) yet in much different circumstances. We eat
            well-processed foods that have dramatically less bacteria and much
            more oversight before they land on our dinner plates. We have
            evolved from raw meat eaters, to stew makers, to farmers, and
            finally where we are today. Periods of time are marked by our food.
            We don’t drink mead and eat solely potatoes too often anymore, but
            if you grew up in the Medieval era or in Ireland hundreds of years
            ago, you probably did. The evolution of food in its physical form is
            most clear in the fact that our appendix is no longer a necessary
            organ! Our appendix is well-regarded to have helped in our digestion
            when we were eating, yes you guessed it, raw meat and tree bark.
            However, with a more refined diet, humans have lost the necessity
            for it. In fact, many get it removed due to ruptures.
          </p>

            We went from hunting animals and eating them fresh, to scrolling on
            our phones for the best philly cheesesteak near us. One day, we
            should put a slab of moose down next to an Omakase dinner to really
            see the evolution of food in its most obvious light. Advancement in
            technology and more structured systems for manufacturing food have
            allowed for food to take on entirely new forms.
