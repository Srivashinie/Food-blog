            We have all heard that itâ€™s best to eat a healthy diet. And we all
            likely know about some of the benefits of a diet that is rich in
            fruits, vegetables, and other nutrient-rich foods. But do you know
            what healthy eating really means? According to the UK website for
            the NHS, healthy eating means that you eat a large variety of
            different foods in the correct proportion. It means that you consume
            the right amount of food and beverages to achieve, and continue to
            maintain, a healthy weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            A healthy diet plan should provide you with the right amount of
            calories for energy to maintain a proper balance. When you have a
            good energy balance with your diet, the calories in the food you
            consume are equal to the calories used by your body that day. This
            means that you eat enough food to keep you sustained, but not so
            much that it causes you to gain weight. Because no two people use
            the same amount of energy each day, it can be difficult to make a
            single suggestion for the right caloric intake that would work for
            everyone. Therefore, finding out the how many calories you burn per
            day based on how active your are would be very helpful when planing
            a healthy diet plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all healthy substitutes are created equal. A vegetarian diet,
            for example, may be great for some individuals. But the foods cater
            to vegetarians are not always the best options for you. Many
            processed vegetarian meat substitutes made with soy products and/or
            large amount of sodium are not good for your health. If you are only
            switching to a vegetarian diet for health reasons, keep the same
            mindset. Only eating fresh foods instead of packaged and processed
            foods.
